    """
    This class intends to send the drone a non-movement signal every 2 seconds

    Attributes:
        state (bool): Mimics the drone state.
        callback (function): External function the signalling_system use to update drone.
        signal (str): The message the signalling_system sends to the drone
        generator_thread (threading.Thread): The thread responsible for generating signal.

    Methods:
        trigger(): Sends out a signal approximately every 10 seconds while drone is left turned on.
        start(): Starts the signalling thread.
        stop(): Stops the signalling thread.
