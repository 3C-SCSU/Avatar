## ⚠️ Common Questions

### "I see error messages about drone/NAO"
**This is normal!** If you don't have the physical hardware connected, you'll see errors. The application will continue to work - you can still test the UI and other features.

### "I see a warning about pkg_resources"
**This is harmless!** It's a warning from the BrainFlow library and doesn't affect functionality.

### "The application won't start"
Try this:
```bash
chmod +x run_gui.sh
./run_gui.sh
```

If that doesn't work, see **SETUP_GUIDE.md** for detailed troubleshooting.
