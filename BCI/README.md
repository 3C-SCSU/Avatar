### Cloud Computinng Club

Gain experience with hands on projects in a professional development environment focusing on the latest and emerging cloud computing technologies, Brain-Computer Interface and Machine Learning. The club maintains a number of VPS managed by a rotating club administrator. Members have an opportunity to develop on the VPS or run for the administrator position.

Currently working on the Avatar project. Users mentally control drones and robots using a machine learning model trained on brainwaves.

Join us at our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mxbQ7HpPjq) for more information. Also Check our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@3CSCSU/) for new videos and Tutorials. 

All members of [Cloud Computing Club](https://huskiesconnect.stcloudstate.edu/organization/3c) have access to the ISELF205, which allows the club members to sharpen their skills into developing a strong portfolio that helps growing professionally.

### Avatar Project

Brainwave Machine Learning for drones and robots. Moving the world with your mind.

The bleeding-edge intersection of neuro-haptics, brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, and machine learning to enable the creation and control of humanoid robots and flying avatars. Our work integrates neuroscience and haptic feedback to develop human computer system interfaces that allow users to control cyber physical systems using their brain signals. This innovative approach uses advanced artificial intelligence to classify signal patterns and respond to brain thoughts in real-time, providing an avatar birdâ€™s eyes feeling. The project development approaches the challenges and opportunities associated with Neuro-Haptics BCI for immersive avatars, paving the way for a new era in human-computer interaction.

### Autonomous Systems Laboratory

The Autonomous Systems Laboratory (ISELF205) is a cutting-edge research hub that equips students with state-of-the-art tools to develop projects in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Cloud Computing. The lab boasts an impressive setup, featuring five BCI headsets, eight workstations with dual PCs, including six Linux-powered Chromebooks, and a dedicated NVIDIA GPU server for high-performance computing. Students also have access to four tablets, four smartphones, four VR headsets, and four drones, creating a versatile platform for immersive and autonomous systems research. A large monitor and smart TV serve as central display units, complemented by a Nao6 humanoid robot that facilitates hands-on experimentation. By integrating software, hardware, and human biology with brain-computer interfaces, this advanced infrastructure empowers students and researchers to push the boundaries of autonomous systems technology and explore innovative frontiers.
