Members by promotion and merit voted in the weekly's #3C meeting:

1. Sporadic contributors: any developer who decides to start contributing to the project's code base.

2. Committers: contributors promoted above the so-called sporadic contributors. To become a committer, the person must get 20 patches approved. When becoming a committer, then the committer will review and support code submitted from sporadic contributors

3. Reviewers: are generally either the founding developers of the project - like initial administrator developers; or contributors who become committers, who then, after 50 patch contributions to the project's code base, are promoted to the status of reviewers. Reviewers will decide and review any conflict in code contributions to the project.
