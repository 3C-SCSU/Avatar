# installModules.py

installModules.py is a setup utility for the CSCU Avatar Project.
It installs all required Python libraries used throughout the project.

## When to Run This Module

Run this module once, immediately after downloading or cloning the repository for the first time.
This ensures that all required dependencies are installed before using or developing the Avatar system.

## How It Works

When executed, the module installs all required Python libraries defined inside its configuration.
It does not run automatically — you must run it manually — and it closes once installation is finished.

## How to Run

You may run installModules.py in any of the following ways:

### 1. Run from Terminal or Command Prompt

Navigate to the project directory and run: python installModules.py
or, on some systems:python3 installModules.py


### 2. Run from Inside Python

From a Python shell:
import installModules
installModules.main()  # or the module’s entry function name


### 3. Run from an IDE (IDLE, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.)

You can run the installer from most Python-friendly editors:

Option A — Open and Run the File
Open your IDE (IDLE, VS Code, PyCharm, Thonny, etc.)
Open the file installModules.py
Run the file:
IDLE: Press F5 or go to Run → Run Module
Visual Studio Code: Press F5 or click the Run button
PyCharm: Right-click the file and select Run 'installModules'
Thonny: Press F5 or click Run

Option B — Use the IDE’s Integrated Terminal
Open the terminal in your IDE and run:
python installModules.py






After installation completes, all required libraries will be available and the CSCU Avatar Project is ready to run.
